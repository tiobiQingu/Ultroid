P90X2 consists of 12 workouts that are divided into three phases: Foundation, Strength, and Performance. Each phase lasts for four to six weeks and focuses on a different aspect of fitness. You can customize your schedule according to your needs and preferences. You will also need some equipment such as dumbbells, resistance bands, stability ball, medicine ball, foam roller, and a pull-up bar.
 
Some of the workouts in P90X2 are:
 
- X2 Core: This workout targets your core muscles and improves your balance and stability.
- X2 Balance + Power: This workout challenges your strength and coordination with complex movements and explosive exercises.
- X2 Yoga: This workout improves your flexibility and mobility with dynamic yoga poses.
- X2 Total Body: This workout works your entire body with compound exercises that involve multiple muscle groups.
- X2 Ab Ripper: This workout sculpts your abs and obliques with intense core exercises.

P90X2 is not for beginners or people who are looking for a quick fix. It requires dedication, discipline, and hard work. But if you are ready to push yourself beyond your limits and achieve amazing results, then P90X2 is for you.

One of the unique features of P90X2 is the use of post-activation potentiation (PAP). PAP is a technique that involves performing a heavy resistance exercise followed by a plyometric or explosive exercise that targets the same muscle group. This creates a neuromuscular response that enhances your power and performance. PAP is used in some of the workouts in the Strength and Performance phases of P90X2.
 
P90X2 also incorporates recovery and mobility exercises that help you prevent injuries and improve your range of motion. You will use a foam roller and a rumble roller to massage your muscles and release tension. You will also do some stretching and yoga to improve your flexibility and alignment.
 
P90X2 comes with a nutrition guide that helps you fuel your body for optimal performance. The nutrition guide is based on three phases: Fat Shredder, Energy Booster, and Endurance Maximizer. Each phase corresponds to the fitness phase of the program and provides you with the right amount of calories, protein, carbs, and fat. You can also choose from different meal plans and recipes that suit your taste and lifestyle.

P90X2 comes with a fitness guide that explains the program in detail and provides you with tips and instructions for each workout. You will also get a workout calendar that shows you what workout to do each day and when to take a rest or recovery week. You can also use the online tools and support from the Beachbody website and community to track your progress and get feedback from other P90X2 users and trainers.
 
P90X2 is not an easy program, but it is worth it. You will see amazing improvements in your strength, power, speed, agility, balance, and core stability. You will also burn fat, build muscle, and enhance your overall health and fitness. P90X2 is the ultimate workout program for athletes who want to take their performance to the next level.
